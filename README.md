Complex Insulin Calculator GUI Project – Matt Hakin

This is the same code written as part of my Complex Insulin Calculator Project but with a GUI on top to make it easier to use. Description of the original project is below:

A Simple python-based calculator to work out Insulin dosage

Based upon my initial Simple Insulin Calculator Project (https://github.com/mattyhakin/simpleinsulincalc).

This calculator can calculator an Insulin dose based upon a number of factors such as Blood Sugar reading, meal type and last dosage of Insulin.

The Blood Sugar ranges, meal type ratios and correctional dosages are all sorted as variables in the code so can be changed to tailor to the users need and treatment.

The calculator could be useful for Diabetics who are getting used to the math that comes with working out dosage based upon an ever- changing saturation with ratios.
